# Fiberphotometry-Analysis
This is a Matlab script to analyze in vivo fiber photometry in rats during a discrimination task.   This uses Nexus files to analyze the raw signal of the 405nm and 465 nm LED channels seperately and relate these signals to the behavioral data ( cue onset, port entrys and licks).
